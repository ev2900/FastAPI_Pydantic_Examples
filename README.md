[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a Python library and web framework designed for building APIs. It has the performance of comparable NodeJS and Go with the ease and familiarity of Python.

[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) is a Python library used for data validation management.

FastAPI combined with Pydantic can be a great compromise between a light weight easy to build web framework that is still production ready.

This repository has a collection of examples that build on each other and add complexity. I put these examples together in a repository so I can have them as a reference and so other may benefit as well.

Below are the details of what is in each example
* [Example_1](https://github.com/ev2900/FastAPI_Pydantic_Examples/tree/main/Example_1) - Basic API routes
* [Example_2](https://github.com/ev2900/FastAPI_Pydantic_Examples/tree/main/Example_2) - Path Parameters / Data Validation with Type-Hints & Enums
* [Example_3](https://github.com/ev2900/FastAPI_Pydantic_Examples/tree/main/Example_3) - Model Classes and Nested Models
* [Example_4](https://github.com/ev2900/FastAPI_Pydantic_Examples/tree/main/Example_4) - URL Query Parameters for Filtering
* [Example_5](https://github.com/ev2900/FastAPI_Pydantic_Examples/tree/main/Example_5) - Request Body and POST requests + Pydantic pre-validators
* [Example_6](https://github.com/ev2900/FastAPI_Pydantic_Examples/tree/main/Example_6) - Annotated Type for Data Validation + Metadata

# Set Up
To run the examples you will need to install FastAPI and Pydantic. I built these examples using Pydantic version 2.11.7 and FastAPI version 0.116.1
