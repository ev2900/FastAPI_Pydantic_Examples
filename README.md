# FastAPI with Pydantic Examples

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a Python library and web framework designed for building APIs. It has the performance of comparable NodeJS and Go with the ease and familiarity of Python. 

[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) is a Python library used for data validation management.

FastAPI combined with Pydantic can be a great compromise between a light weight easy to build webframe work that is still production ready.
