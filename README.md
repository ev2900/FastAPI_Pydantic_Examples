# FastAPI with Pydantic Examples

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a Python library and web framework designed for building APIs. It has the performance of comparable NodeJS and Go with the ease and familiarity of Python. 

[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) is a Python library used for data validation management.

FastAPI combined with Pydantic can be a great compromise between a light weight easy to build web framework that is still production ready.

This repository has a collection of examples that build on each other and add complexity. I put these examples together in a repository so I can have them as a reference and so other may benefit as well. 

Below are the details of what is in each example
